How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	you can modify what you want to go in to a specific commit. Still don't know how to 'cherry pick' line by line like you can in Xcode

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	by adding or removing files as necessary
